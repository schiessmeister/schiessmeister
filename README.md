# Technical Implementation Details

### Backend Architecture

The backend architecture is built on .NET Core and utilizes Entity Framework Core (EFCore) for database access and management. A REST API, developed with WebAPI, provides the necessary endpoints for data communication. The Identity Framework is implemented to meet security requirements for authentication and authorization.

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend provides a comprehensive interface that covers all relevant use cases. Organizers can view their competitions, create new events, manage participants, and track live results through an intuitive interface.

### Real-time Communication

The application implements two-way communication (WebSocket/SignalR) to enable dynamic and interactive usage. This ensures that changes such as point entries or new participants are immediately reflected in the live result display.
